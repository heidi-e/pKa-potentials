### Top ten couplings for catalytic residues
Python script that reads in .mom file, pkaS-potentials file, and Rstudio data to calculate the top ten couplings that interact with catalytic lysine, aspertate, and glutamate residues to give them their catalytic properties. 

Packages required:
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import re
import os
```
